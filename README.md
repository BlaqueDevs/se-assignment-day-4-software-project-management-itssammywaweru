Strategies to Prevent Budget Overruns
1.Accurate Budget Estimation
2.Prevent scope creep by setting strict change control processes.
3.Implement incremental funding in Agile sprints to control spending.
4.Track expenses using cost management tools (e.g., Jira, Asana, Microsoft Project).
5.Optimize Resource Allocation
6.Reduce licensing costs by using free frameworks, libraries, and cloud services.
7.Implement CI/CD pipelines to reduce manual testing costs.
## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
1.Waterfall follows a linear and sequential development process, where each phase (requirements, design, development, testing, deployment) must be completed before moving to the next.
Agile is iterative and incremental, breaking the project into small, manageable cycles (sprints) that allow continuous improvement and adaptation.

2.Waterfall is rigid, making it difficult to accommodate changes once the project has started. Any modification requires going back to earlier phases.
Agile is highly flexible, allowing teams to adjust features, priorities, and deliverables based on feedback throughout the development cycle.

3.Waterfall delivers a fully completed product at the end, meaning users must wait until the final phase to see the results.
Agile delivers a working product in iterations, providing usable features at the end of each sprint.

4.Waterfall includes testing only after development is finished, which can lead to discovering major issues late in the project.
Agile incorporates continuous testing and feedback after every sprint, allowing issues to be addressed early.

5.Waterfall is best suited for fixed-scope projects where all requirements are known in advance, offering predictable costs and timelines.
Agile is ideal for dynamic projects where requirements may evolve, but this can make budgeting and scheduling less predictable.

6.Waterfall follows a structured hierarchy, with minimal client and team interaction after the initial planning phase.
Agile promotes continuous collaboration among developers, testers, and stakeholders, requiring regular communication and teamwork.

7.Waterfall requires extensive documentation upfront, making it easier to track progress but potentially slowing down execution.
Agile prioritizes working software over documentation, which can lead to gaps in record-keeping if not properly managed.

8.Waterfall is riskier because issues are often discovered late in development when changes are costly.
Agile mitigates risks early by identifying and fixing problems incrementally.

When to Use Each Methodology?
Waterfall is best for projects with fixed requirements, such as government systems, regulatory applications, or large-scale enterprise solutions.
Agile is best for projects requiring frequent updates and flexibility, such as startups, web applications, and software products that evolve over time.
## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
Examples of Agile-Friendly Projects:
Software Startups & MVP Development

Startups often build Minimum Viable Products (MVPs) to test market demand and refine features based on user feedback.
Example: A new food delivery app that starts with core features (ordering, payment) and adds functionalities (loyalty programs, AI recommendations) over time.
Web and Mobile Applications

User expectations change rapidly, requiring continuous updates, new features, and performance improvements.
Example: Social media platforms like Facebook or Instagram, where new features are tested and improved iteratively.
E-commerce Platforms

Online shopping trends shift frequently, requiring businesses to adapt quickly.
Example: Amazon implementing AI-driven product recommendations and A/B testing checkout improvements.
Game Development

Game design evolves based on user feedback, bug fixes, and performance optimizations.
Example: Fortnite, which continuously updates its gameplay, maps, and in-game events based on player feedback.
AI & Machine Learning Projects

AI models requi
re continuous training, testing, and refinement based on real-world data.
Example: A chatbot for customer support that improves through iterative testing and retraining.
